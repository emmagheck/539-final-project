    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="index">Welcome! My name is Emma and I'm a second-year MSI student at the University of Michigan School of Information studying Digital Curation. <br> <br> As my final project for SI 539, I've compiled groups of my favorite albums and podcasts. As a student, I spend a lot of time listening to music and podcasts while completing tasksâ€” whether I'm doing school work, chores, or working out, chances are I have my airpods in. Take a look around to explore some of the media I enjoy listening to.</p>
