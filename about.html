<h1>About this Site</h1>

<h2>This site was created as a place to learn more about the dolls in American Girl's Historical line. The Historical dolls were originally released by the Pleasant Company in 1986. The line-up of dolls in the initial release included only 3 characters: Kirsten, Samantha, and Molly. Today, there are 18 Historical Characters, ranging from 1774 to the early 2000s.</h2>
